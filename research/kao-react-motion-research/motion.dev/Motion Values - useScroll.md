# useScroll

useScroll is used to create scroll-linked animations, like progress indicators and parallax effects.

```javascript
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll()


return <motion.div style={{ scaleX: scrollYProgress }} />
```

useScroll is able to run some animations with the browser's ScrollTimeline API for optimal hardware-accelerated performance, removing scroll measurements, improving scroll synchronisation and ensuring animations remain smooth even under heavy CPI usage.

## Usage

Import useScroll from Motion:

```javascript
import { useScroll } from "motion/react"
```

useScroll returns four motion values:

* scrollX/Y: The absolute scroll position, in pixels.
scrollX/Y: The absolute scroll position, in pixels.

* scrollXProgress/YProgress: The scroll position between the defined offsets, as a value between 0 and 1.
scrollXProgress/YProgress: The scroll position between the defined offsets, as a value between 0 and 1.

### Page scroll

By default, useScroll tracks the page scroll.

```javascript
const { scrollY } = useScroll()


useMotionValueEvent(scrollY, "change", (latest) => {
  console.log("Page scroll: ", latest)
})
```

For example, we could show a page scroll indicator by passing scrollYProgress straight to the scaleX style of a progress bar.

```javascript
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll()


return <motion.div style={{ scaleX: scrollYProgress }} />
```

As useScroll returns motion values, we can compose this scroll info with other motion value hooks like useTransform and useSpring:

```javascript
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll()
const scaleX = useSpring(scrollYProgress)

return <motion.div style={{ scaleX }} />
```

Since scrollY is a MotionValue, there's a neat trick you can use to tell when the user's scroll direction changes:

```javascript
const { scrollY } = useScroll()
const [scrollDirection, setScrollDirection] = useState("down")

useMotionValueEvent(scrollY, "change", (current) => {
  const diff = current - scrollY.getPrevious()
  setScrollDirection(diff > 0 ? "down" : "up")
})
```

Perfect for triggering a sticky header animation!

### Element scroll

To track the scroll position of a scrollable element we can pass the element's ref to useScroll's container option:

```javascript
const carouselRef = useRef(null)
const { scrollX } = useScroll({
  container: carouselRef
})

return (
  <div ref={carouselRef} style={{ overflow: "scroll" }}>
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

### Element position

We can track the progress of an element as it moves within a container by passing its ref to the target option.

```javascript
const ref = useRef(null)
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({
  target: ref,
  offset: ["start end", "end end"]
})

return <div ref={ref}>
```

In this example, each item has its own progress indicator.

### Scroll offsets

With the offset option we can define which parts of the element we want to track with the viewport, for instance track elements as they enter in from the bottom, leave at the top, or travel throughout the whole viewport.

## Performance

Browsers are capable of animating some values, like opacity, transform, clipPath and filter, entirely on the GPU. This improves scroll synchronisation and ensures animations remain smooth even when sites are performing heavy work.

useScroll is also capable of running animations via the GPU. By passing scrollXProgress or scrollYProgress either directly to an opacity style, or via  useTransform to one of the above styles, it will create a hardware-accelerated animation.

```javascript
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll()
const filter = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 1], ["blur(10px)", "blur(0px)"])

return <motion.div style={{ opacity: scrollYProgress, filter }} />
```

## Options

useScroll accepts the following options.

### container

Default: Viewport

The scrollable container to track the scroll position of. By default, this is the browser viewport. By passing a ref to a scrollable element, that element can be used instead.

```javascript
const containerRef = useRef(null)
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({ container: containerRef })
```

### target

useScroll tracks the progress of the target within the container. By default, the target is the scrollable area of the container. It can additionally be set as another element, to track its progress within the container.

```javascript
const targetRef = useRef(null)
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({ target: targetRef })
```

### axis

Default: "y"

The tracked axis for the defined offset.

### offset

Default: ["start start", "end end"]

offset describes intersections, points where the target and container meet.

For example, the intersection "start end" means when the start of the target on the tracked axis meets the end of the container.

So if the target is an element, the container is the window, and we're tracking the vertical axis then "start end" is where the top of the element meets the bottom of the viewport.

#### Accepted intersections

Both target and container points can be defined as:

* Number: A value where 0 represents the start of the axis and 1 represents the end. So to define the top of the target with the middle of the container you could define "0 0.5". Values outside this range are permitted.
Number: A value where 0 represents the start of the axis and 1 represents the end. So to define the top of the target with the middle of the container you could define "0 0.5". Values outside this range are permitted.

* Names: "start", "center" and "end" can be used as clear shortcuts for 0, 0.5 and 1 respectively.
Names: "start", "center" and "end" can be used as clear shortcuts for 0, 0.5 and 1 respectively.

* Pixels: Pixel values like "100px", "-50px" will be defined as that number of pixels from the start of the target/container.
Pixels: Pixel values like "100px", "-50px" will be defined as that number of pixels from the start of the target/container.

* Percent: Same as raw numbers but expressed as "0%" to "100%".
Percent: Same as raw numbers but expressed as "0%" to "100%".

* Viewport: "vh" and "vw" units are accepted.
Viewport: "vh" and "vw" units are accepted.

```javascript
// Track an element as it enters from the bottom
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({
  target: targetRef,
  offset: ["start end", "end end"]
})

// Track an element as it moves out the top
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({
  target: targetRef,
  offset: ["start start", "end start"]
})
```

### trackContentSize

Default: false

When the size of a page or element's content changes, its scrollable area can change too. But, because browsers don't provide a callback for changes in content size, by default useScroll() will not update until the next "scroll" event.

Content size tracking is disabled by default because most of the time, scrollable area remains stable, and tracking changes to it involves a small overhead.

useScroll can automatically track changes to content size by setting trackContentSize to true.

```javascript
useScroll({ trackContentSize: true })
```
